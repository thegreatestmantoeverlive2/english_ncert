        "question": "How long ago was the interview invented?",
        "answer": "Since its invention a little over 130 years ago, the interview has become a commonplace of journalism. Today, almost everybody who is literate will have read an interview at some point in their lives, while from the other point of view, several thousand celebrities have been interviewed over the years, some of them repeatedly. So it is hardly surprising that opinions of the interview \u2014 of its functions, methods and merits \u2014 vary considerably. Some might make quite extravagant claims for it as being, in its highest form, a source of truth, and, in its practice, an art. Others, usually celebrities who see themselves as its victims, might despise the interview as an unwarranted intrusion into their lives, or feel that it somehow diminishes them, just as in some primitive cultures it is believed that if one takes a photographic portrait of somebody then one is stealing that person\u2019s soul. V. S. Naipaul\u00b9 \u2018feels that some people are wounded by interviews and lose a part of themselves,\u2019 Lewis Carroll, the creator of Alice in Wonderland, was said to have had \u2018a just horror of the interviewer\u2019 and he never consented to be interviewed. It was his horror of being lionized which made him thus repel would be acquaintances, interviewers, and the persistent petitioners for his autograph and he would afterwards relate the stories of his success in silencing all such people with much satisfaction and amusement. Rudyard Kipling\u00b2 expressed an even more condemnatory attitude towards the interviewer. His wife, Caroline, writes in her diary for 14 October 1892 that their day was \u2018wrecked by two reporters from Boston\u2019. She reports her husband as saying to the reporters, \u201cWhy do I refuse to be interviewed? Because it is immoral! It is a crime, just as much of a crime as an offence against my person, as an assault, and just as much merits punishment. It is cowardly and vile. No respectable man would ask it, much less give it,\u201d Yet Kipling had himself perpetrated such an \u2018assault\u2019 on Mark Twain only a few years before. H. G. Wells\u00b3 in an interview in 1894 referred to \u2018the interviewing ordeal\u2019, but was a fairly frequent interviewee and forty years later found himself interviewing Joseph Stalin\u2074. Saul Bellow\u2075, who has consented to be interviewed on several occasions, nevertheless once described interviews as being like thumbprints on his windpipe.

So it is hardly surprising that opinions of the interview \u2014 of its functions, methods and merits \u2014 vary considerably.
